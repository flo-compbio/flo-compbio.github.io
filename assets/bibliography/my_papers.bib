	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the systematic identification of cell populations in a tissue, but characterizing their spatial organization remains challenging. We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method that reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple adjacent cells, with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample. To annotate the precise cellular composition of distinct tissue regions, we introduce a method for multimodal intersection analysis. Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors, we find that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells have spatially restricted enrichments, as well as distinct coenrichments with other cell types. Furthermore, we identify colocalization of inflammatory fibroblasts and cancer cells expressing a stress-response gene module. Our approach for mapping the architecture of scRNA-seq-defined subpopulations can be applied to reveal the interactions inherent to complex tissues.},

	abstract = {The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Our single-cell transcriptomic data of human and mouse spermatogenesis provide evidence that this widespread transcription maintains DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through a mechanism we term transcriptional scanning. We find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary timescales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning shapes germline mutation signatures and modulates mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for faster evolution in a specific subset.},

	abstract = {{METHOD}: Genome-wide expression profiling is a widely used approach for characterizing heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such data typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis ({PCA}) or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit prior knowledge about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce {GO}-{PCA}, an unsupervised method that combines {PCA} with nonparametric {GO} enrichment analysis, in order to systematically search for sets of genes that are both strongly correlated and closely functionally related. These gene sets are then used to automatically generate expression signatures with functional labels, which collectively aim to provide a readily interpretable representation of biologically relevant similarities and differences. The robustness of the results obtained can be assessed by bootstrapping.
{RESULTS}: I first applied {GO}-{PCA} to datasets containing diverse hematopoietic cell types from human and mouse, respectively. In both cases, {GO}-{PCA} generated a small number of signatures that represented the majority of lineages present, and whose labels reflected their respective biological characteristics. I then applied {GO}-{PCA} to human glioblastoma ({GBM}) data, and recovered signatures associated with four out of five previously defined {GBM} subtypes. My results demonstrate that {GO}-{PCA} is a powerful and versatile exploratory method that reduces an expression matrix containing thousands of genes to a much smaller set of interpretable signatures. In this way, {GO}-{PCA} aims to facilitate hypothesis generation, design of further analyses, and functional comparisons across datasets.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing has allowed for unprecedented detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient application to single cells is challenged by the small starting amounts of {RNA}. We have developed {CEL}-Seq, a method for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before linearly amplifying {mRNA} with the use of one round of in vitro transcription. We show that {CEL}-Seq gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a {PCR}-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by {CEL}-Seq will be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues containing populations of diverse cell types.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in developmental biology relates to the connection between morphological stages and their underlying molecular activity. Here we demonstrate that, at the molecular level, embryonic development in five Caenorhabditis species proceeds through two distinct milestones in which the transcriptome is resistant to differences in species-specific developmental timings. By comparing the complete protein-coding transcriptomes of individually timed embryos across ten morphological markers, we found that developmental milestones can be characterized by their expression dynamics and activation of key developmental regulators. This approach led us to discover the nematode phylotypic stage and to show that in chordates and arthropods it is represented as two distinct stages, suggesting that animal body plans might evolve by uncoupling and elaboration on formerly synchronous processes.},
