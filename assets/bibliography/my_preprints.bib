	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-Seq is a powerful technology that enables the transcriptomic profiling of the different cell populations that make up complex tissues. However, the noisy and high-dimensional nature of the generated data poses significant challenges for its analysis and integration. Here, I describe Monet, an open-source Python package designed to provide effective and computationally efficient solutions to some of the most common challenges encountered in scRNA-Seq data analysis, and to serve as a toolkit for scRNA-Seq method development. At its core, Monet implements algorithms to infer the dimensionality and construct a PCA-based latent space from a given dataset. This latent space, represented by a MonetModel object, then forms the basis for data analysis and integration. In addition to validating these core algorithms, I provide demonstrations of some more advanced analysis tasks currently supported, such as batch correction and label transfer, which are useful for analyzing multiple datasets from the same tissue. Monet is available at https://github.com/flo-compbio/monet. Ongoing work is focused on providing electronic notebooks with tutorials for individual analysis tasks, and on developing interoperability with other Python scRNA-Seq software. The author welcomes suggestions for future improvements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, as popular clustering methods operate largely independently of visualization techniques, the fine-tuning of clustering parameters can be unintuitive and time-consuming. Here, I propose \textit{Galapagos}, a simple and effective clustering workflow based on t-SNE and DBSCAN that does not require a gene selection step. In practice, Galapagos only involves the fine-tuning of two parameters, which is straightforward, as clustering is performed directly on the t-SNE visualization results. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a model tissue, I validate the effectiveness of Galapagos in different ways. First, I show that Galapagos generates clusters corresponding to all main cell types present. Then, I demonstrate that the t-SNE results are robust to parameter choices and initialization points. Next, I employ a simulation approach to show that clustering with Galapagos is accurate and robust to the high levels of technical noise present. Finally, to demonstrate Galapagos’ accuracy on real data, I compare clustering results to true cell type identities established using CITE-Seq data. In this context, I also provide an example of the primary limitation of Galapagos, namely the difficulty to resolve related cell types in cases where t-SNE fails to clearly separate the cells. Galapagos helps to make clustering scRNA-Seq data more intuitive and reproducible, and can be implemented in most programming languages with only a few lines of code.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell RNA-Seq measurements are commonly affected by high levels of technical noise, posing challenges for data analysis and visualization. A diverse array of methods has been proposed to computationally remove noise by sharing information across similar cells or genes, however their respective accuracies have been difficult to establish. Here, we propose a simple denoising strategy based on principal component analysis (PCA). We show that while PCA performed on raw data is biased towards highly expressed genes, this bias can be mitigated with a cell aggregation step, allowing the recovery of denoised expression values for both highly and lowly expressed genes. We benchmark our resulting ENHANCE algorithm and three previously described methods on simulated data that closely mimic real datasets, showing that ENHANCE provides the best overall denoising accuracy, recovering modules of co-expressed genes and cell subpopulations.

However, it is currently unclear how to establish formal cell type definitions, which impedes the systematic analysis of scRNA-Seq data across experiments and studies. To address this challenge, we have developed \textit{Moana}, a hierarchical machine learning framework that enables the construction of robust cell type classifiers from heterogeneous scRNA-Seq datasets. To demonstrate \textit{Moana}’s capabilities, we construct cell type classifiers for human immune cells that accurately distinguish between closely related cell types in the presence of experimental perturbations and systematic differences between scRNA-Seq protocols. We show that \textit{Moana} is generally applicable and scales to datasets with more than ten thousand cells, thus enabling the construction of tissue-specific cell type atlases that can be directly applied to analyze new scRNASeq datasets.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}High-throughput single-cell {RNA}-Seq ({scRNA}-Seq) is a powerful approach for studying heterogeneous tissues and dynamic cellular processes. However, compared to bulk {RNA}-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing ({kNN}-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by {UMI}-filtered {scRNA}-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that {kNN}-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the {kNN}-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, {kNN}-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of {scRNA}-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

	abstract = {The nonparametric minimum hypergeometric ({mHG}) test is a popular alternative to Kolmogorov-Smirnov ({KS})-type tests for determining gene set enrichment. However, these approaches have not been compared to each other in a quantitative manner. Here, I first perform a simulation study to show that the {mHG} test is significantly more powerful than the one-sided {KS} test for detecting gene set enrichment. I then illustrate a shortcoming of the {mHG} test, which has motivated a semiparametric generalization of the test, termed the {XL}-{mHG} test. I describe an improved quadratic-time algorithm for the efficient calculation of exact {XL}-{mHG} p-values, as well as a linear-time algorithm for calculating a tighter upper bound for the p-value. Finally, I demonstrate that the {XL}-{mHG} test outperforms the one-sided {KS} test when applied to a reference gene expression study, and discuss general principles for analyzing gene set enrichment using the {XL}-{mHG} test. An efficient open-source Python/Cython implementation of the {XL}-{mHG} test is provided in the xlmhg package, available from {PyPI} and {GitHub} (https://github.com/flo-compbio/xlmhg) under an {OSI}-approved license.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a cost-efficient and widely used method to characterize heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such datasets typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit the significant amount of knowledge that exists about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce {GO}-{PCA}, an unsupervised method that incorporates prior knowledge about gene functions in the form of gene ontology ({GO}) annotations. {GO}-{PCA} aims to discover and represent biological heterogeneity along all major axes of variation in a given dataset, while suppressing heterogeneity due to technical biases. To this end, {GO}-{PCA} combines principal component analysis ({PCA}) with nonparametric {GO} enrichment analysis, and uses the results to generate expression signatures based on small sets of functionally related genes. I first applied {GO}-{PCA} to expression data from diverse lineages of the human hematopoietic system, and obtained a small set of signatures that captured known cell characteristics for most lineages. I then applied the method to expression profiles of glioblastoma ({GBM}) tumor biopsies, and obtained signatures that were strongly associated with multiple previously described {GBM} subtypes. Surprisingly, {GO}-{PCA} discovered a cell cycle-related signature that exhibited significant differences between the Proneural and the prognostically favorable {GBM} {CpG} Island Methylator (G-{CIMP}) subtypes, suggesting that the G-{CIMP} subtype is characterized in part by lower mitotic activity. Previous expression-based classifications have failed to separate these subtypes, demonstrating that {GO}-{PCA} can detect heterogeneity that is missed by other methods. My results show that {GO}-{PCA} is a powerful and versatile expression-based method that facilitates exploration of large-scale expression data, without requiring additional types of experimental data. The low-dimensional representation generated by {GO}-{PCA} lends itself to interpretation, hypothesis generation, and further analysis.},
